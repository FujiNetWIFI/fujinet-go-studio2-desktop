"""Render the desktop icon set from the shared FujiNet Go launcher art.

The artwork (data/icons/src/fujinet-go-studio2-foreground.png) is the exact
same transparent FujiNet mark the other desktop apps use -- byte-identical
to the siblings' copies -- composited over this product's own background
colour, so the whole family reads as one product line while each target
still gets a distinct badge colour.

Two things are specific to this target, both the user's choice (2026-10-20):

  * Background is #C8B58C, the RCA Studio II's case tan, sampled from the
    console photo in fujinet-ads/studio2/rca-studio-ii.png -- the same
    colour the frontends use for UI highlights (STUDIO2SESSION_ACCENT_RGB in
    core/include/studio2session.h). It sits close to the Atari 800 app's
    beige (#C8BDA4) but more yellow, as the console is.
  * The mark is INVERTED before compositing, as on the 2600's and 7800's
    icons: the family art is white discs and lines around one black centre
    disc, which would wash out on a light ground, so the RGB channels are
    inverted (alpha untouched) -- the mark comes out in the black of the
    console's keys, the centre disc white.

Everything else about the composite (rounded-square mask, corner radius,
foreground zoom, output sizes) matches the sibling repos' own
tools/icons/make-icons.py exactly.

The results are committed (data/icons/hicolor/..., data/icons/*.icns,
frontends/windows/app.ico) so building the project needs no image tooling;
re-run this only when the artwork or background colour changes:
